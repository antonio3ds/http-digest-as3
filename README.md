http-digest-as3
===============

This class provides HTTP Digest authentication support for AS3. Adobe AIR offers some HTTP Digest support in the form of a prompt that is displayed automatically to the user; this class allows you to control the supply of credentials (hardcoded, a custom-built form, etc.) and is not limited to Adobe AIR.
HTTP Digest relies on MD5 cryptography; the HTTP Digest class found here relies on the as3corelib package for MD5 encryption. The as3corelib package can be found here: https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib
